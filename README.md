# Philadelphia Crime



#### This project was inspired by pure curiosity of the level of different crime going on in Philly. In 2024, my then next-door neighbors consistently got their packages stolen while our own house was unscathed. It was no surpise to see that Theft was a top crime. However, some of the other numbers were surprising as well. 2024 was one for the books. In Philly in particular, it experience some of the lowest homicide levels ever.  Please take a look.
